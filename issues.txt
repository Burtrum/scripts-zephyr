ISSUE 1: KNOWN ISSUE: gdb depends on `python2.7`
Error On `west build`
-- Found toolchain: espressif (/home/robertbc/.espressif/tools/zephyr)
/home/robertbc/.espressif/tools/zephyr/xtensa-esp32-elf/bin/xtensa-esp32-elf-gdb:
error while loading shared libraries: libpython2.7.so.1.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

FIX 1: Install Python2.7
    sudo apt-get --quite --yes --no-install-recommends python2.7-dev

===========================================
ISSUE 2: Install Script Issues Spinx issue I don't care about now.
I suspect that there is a Python `requirements.txt` or a `yaml` file that needs correcting. Since it was *just* `sphinx` I did not try to fix it.
