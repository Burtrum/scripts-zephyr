West configuration file handling.

West follows Git-like conventions for configuration file locations.
There are three types of configuration file: system-wide files apply
to all users on the current machine, global files apply to the current
user, and local files apply to the current west workspace.

System files:

- Linux: /etc/westconfig
- macOS: /usr/local/etc/westconfig
- Windows: %PROGRAMDATA%\west\config

Global files:

- Linux: ~/.westconfig or (if $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is set)
  $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/west/config
- macOS: ~/.westconfig
- Windows: .westconfig in the user's home directory, as determined
  by os.path.expanduser.

Local files:

- Linux, macOS, Windows: <workspace-root-directory>/.west/config

You can override these files' locations with the WEST_CONFIG_SYSTEM,
WEST_CONFIG_GLOBAL, and WEST_CONFIG_LOCAL environment variables.

Configuration values from later configuration files override configuration
from earlier ones. Local values have highest precedence, and system values
lowest.

To get a value for <name>, type:
    west config <name>

To set a value for <name>, type:
    west config <name> <value>

To list all options and their values:
    west config -l

To delete <name> in the local or global file (wherever it's set
first, not in both; if set locally, global values become visible):
    west config -d <name>

To delete <name> in the global file only:
    west config -d --global <name>

To delete <name> everywhere it's set, including the system file:
    west config -D <name>

positional arguments:
  name              config option in section.key format; e.g. "foo.bar" is
                    section "foo", key "bar"
  value             value to set "name" to

optional arguments:
  -h, --help        show this help message and exit
  -l, --list        list all options and their values
  -d, --delete      delete an option in one config file
  -D, --delete-all  delete an option everywhere it's set

configuration file to use (give at most one):
  --system          system-wide file
  --global          global (user-wide) file
  --local           this workspace's file

If the configuration file to use is not set, reads use all three in
precedence order, and writes use the local file.
